        <h1>Aktionariat Terms of Service 0.1</h1>
        <div mt-5>
          <h3>General</h3>
          <p>
            Aktionariat AG provides technical services in connection with tokenized shares.
            These services include our website, our mobile apps, a corporate dashboard for issuers, transaction
            monitoring,
            user notification services, shareholder registrations, and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Service govern the relation between Aktionariat AG and the users of its services.
            Corporate clients may be subject to separate agreements.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div mt-5>
          <h3>Updates</h3>
          <p>
            This is a draft of our terms of service and will be replaced with a more professionally worded version in
            the
            future.
            Future versions might be substantially deviate from the version at hand and users who do not agree with
            future
            versions of our terms of service
            might be forced to stop using our services.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div mt-5>
          <p>
            <h3>Big Disclaimer, no Liability</h3>
            You agree that Aktionariat AG is not liable for any damage in connection with the use of our software and
            services.
            Most notably, Aktionariat AG is not responsible for any loss of funds that happened in connection with our
            services, for example when a user
            accidentally sends crypto assets to the wrong address using our app. All information, software and services
            are provided "as is" with no
            guarantee for being accurate or reliable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div mt-5>
          <p>
            <h3>License Agreement</h3>
            Users that agree with our terms of service are granted a revocable, non-exclusive license to use our
            software
            and services.
            Code that is "open source" is governed by separate license agreements as referred to in the respective
            files.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div mt-5>
          <h3 id="data">Data Protection</h3>
          <p>
            <p>Aktionariat AG processes data from three sources: the public data visible on the Ethereum blockchain,
              issuers
              that work with us, and our users.
              Blockchain-based data is distributed all over the world and outside of our control. Data you store with
              us
              is
              stored on dedicated hardware in Switzerland and Germany.
            </p>

            <p>When using our services (e.g. our app or the widgets we provide to the issuers) to initiate
              blockchain-based
              transactions, you should be aware that these
              transactions will publicly and irrevocably archived on the Ethereum blockchain once you sign them and
              send
              them to the network. These transactions typically include
              information about how many tokens have been bought, sold, transferred or otherwise interacted with, a
              timestamp, and the involved addresses. They
              do not include personal data such as your name or email address. Nonetheless, once someone knows that a
              particular address belongs to you, they can
              connect all the transactions involving that address to you. If, for example, you are concerned with one
              issuer
              not knowing about what tokens of other
              issuers you own, you should use distinct address for distinct issuers.</p>
            <p>
              Issuers that use our services might store personal data about you with us. This mainly concerns the
              shareholder registry and includes your name, address,
              and e-mail. You can view and manage this data through us in the Aktionariat app or alternatively get in
              touch
              with the issuer that entered your data.
              Note that updating your data with one issuer automatically also updates your data with other issuers. If
              you
              do not want your data to be shared between
              issuers, you should use separate accounts for each issuer or group of issuers whose data you wish to be
              kept
              separate.
              Be aware that companies are required by law to keep all information that is relevant for the shareholder
              registry -
              so if we are tasked by an issuer to keep their shareholder registry up to date, we are legally required
              to
              keep your data.
              Even if you are not a shareholder anymore, the law requires all data in connection with an entry in the
              shareholder registry to be kept for another 10 years.

              Furthermore, there is the data you provide us with. This includes your e-mail address and notification
              settings once you subscribe to our newsletter or token notifications.
              We do not use cookies for tracking you (hence no cookie warning), but for keeping your session alive
              once
              you
              login to the corporate dashboard. Also, WalletConnect uses
              cookies to keep its sessions open when our widgets interact with your wallet through <a
                href="https://walletconnect.org/">WalletConnect</a>. Data sent to us
              through your usage of the registration widget or other widgets on the corporate websites of issuers is
              considered to be provided to us by the issuers and not by you
              and governed by the agreement between you and the issuer. Data you enter in the Aktionariat app,
              however,
              is
              governed by this agreement. You can view and edit
              this data at any time in the app. It includes your personal information as well as all the Ethereum
              addresses
              you have associated with your account.
              So far, we have no implemented an account deletion feature yet. If you wish to delete your account,
              please
              get
              in touch with accounts@aktionariat.com .
            </p>

        <div mt-5>
          <h3 id="communication">Communication Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We might send you two types of emails: our own emails and emails sent on behalf of an issuer.
            Our own emails include our newsletter, price updates, and other things you can subscribe to and manage
            here
            (if applicable).
            When installing the app, when registering through the registration widget of the issuer or when an issuer
            adds
            you to the shareholder registry, you are by default subscribed to all events of shares you hold at the
            'reasonable' level.
            You should note that even if you disable all our notifications on this page, issuers might still use our
            services to deliver messages to you on behalf of them.
            This latter category of messages is governed by your agreements with the relevant issuer. In some cases,
            for
            example the invitation to the yearly general assembly,
            the issuer might be required by law to get in touch with you even if you opted out of email communications
            in
            general.
