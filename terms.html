        <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
        <p class="privacy-policy">
          There are two potential sources for the data we have on record: you and the issuers of share tokens that tasked us with keeping their shareholder registries up to date. 
          You can either manage your personal data with the Aktionariat app (the simpler option) or notify the issuer that entered your data about address changes. 
          Updating your data with one issuer automatically also updates your data with other issuers. 
          If you want to be known under different names and addresses with separate issuers, you should also use separate Aktionariat accounts with separate email addresses. 
          If you want to delete your account, write to luzius@aktionariat.com. We handle deletions manually. 
          Be aware that companies are required by law to keep all information that is relevant for the shareholder registry - 
          so if we are tasked by an issuer to keep their shareholder registry up to date, we are required to keep your data. 
          Even if you are not a shareholder anymore, the law requires all data in connection with an entry in the shareholder registry to be kept for another 10 years. 
          See also the Circular 2019/01 by the Swiss Blockchain Federation.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Communication Policy</h4>
        <p class="privacy-policy">
          We might send you two types of emails: our own emails and emails sent on behalf of an issuer.
          Our own emails include our newsletter, price updates, and other things you can subscribe to.
          When installing the app, you are by default subscribed to all events of tokens you hold at the REASONABLE level.
          However, you should note that even if you disable all our notifications, issuers might still use our services to deliver messages to you on behalf of them.
          This latter category of messages is governed by your agreements with the relevant issuer. In some cases, for example the invitation to the yearly general assembly,
          the issuer might be required by law to get in touch with you even if you opted out of email communications in general.
