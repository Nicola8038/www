          <p><b>Dear Shareholders and potential future Shareholders</b></p>
          <p>This simple web page is where I decided to start my journey to bring fundamental investing to the crypto
            world.
            Today, crypto is synonymous with emotional markets that are often detached from fundamentals. While I
            appreciate the playfulness of
            today's crypto markets with all their memes and emojis,
            I am also deeply convinced that in the long run, the fundamental investors will prevail. That's why I
            founded Aktionariat together with <a href="about.html">Murat</a>.
            We want to attract companies of fundamental value to the space of decentralized finance, and to better
            connect them to their current and future
            shareholders. Thereby, we hope to help the crypto markets mature and one day maybe even dethrone the
            established financial markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hereby offer you to join me on my journey by becoming a fellow shareholder of Aktionariat AG. All it takes
            is a plunge
            into the cold water of not-yet-very-userfriendly technology, and a fist full of Ether or <a
              href="https://xchf.ch">crypto francs</a>.
          </p>
          <p>

            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>
              Aktionariat AG is a Swiss corporation based in Zurich with trade register number <a target="_blank"
                href="https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-453.438.437">CHE-453.438.437</a>.
              Its purpose is to enable Swiss companies to create a market for their shares and is defined in more
              general terms in its <a href="assets/terms/Articles of Association.pdf">Articles of Association</a>. Its
              capital is divided into <var class=akt-totalshares></var> shares with a nominal value of 0.10 CHF each,
              out
              of which <var class=akt-treasuryshares></var> shares are held by the company itself.
              On the basis of a <a href="assets/terms/Registration Agreement.pdf">Registration Agreement</a>, <var
                class=akt-totalsupply></var> Aktionariat shares are registered on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20
              tokens named <a target="_blank" class=akt-contractlink><var class=akt-name></var></a>.
              The current <a href="#market">market price</a>
              per share is <var class=akt-price></var>, implying a market capitalization of <var
                class=akt-marketcap></var>.
            </p>
            <div class="py-2">

              All charts, tables, forms, and other widgets on this page are freely configurable, allowing issuers
              to easily create their own investor relations page for their own token.
              Data points like the number of shares in circulation are fetched from the blockchain as the page is
              loaded, ensuring that they stay up to date without manual intervention. For example, the following nice
              price chart can be embedded into any website with just three lines of html. We believe that powerful
              building blocks are invaluable for creating nice investor relations pages. Shareholder communication is
              often underappreciated. Without keeping the market informed, there can be no market at all.

            <h3>Business Model</h3>
            <p>
              Markets work best when they are free and open. We leverage the latest legal and technical
              developments to create liquid markets for securities that hitherto were illiquid and hard to price.
              Even for those not interested in selling their shares, having a reliable price signal can unlock
              substantial value.
              For example, it creates a point of orientation for employees regarding the true value of their shares and
              enables investors to more reliably gauge how well (or not so well) their portfolio is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that being enabler in this market should put us sooner or later into a position where we
              can capture some of the value we create. However, for the foreseeable future, we strictly prioritize
              growth and product development over revenue generation. We also decided to put a laser-sharp focus on the
              technical dimension, leaving legal consulting to partner firm <a target="_blank"
                href="https://lexr.ch">LEXR</a>
              and the provision of auxiliary financial services such as the custody of crypto assets to regulated
              financial
              intermediaries. For the technically savvy, it will always be possible to enjoy the full spectrum of our
              services without relying on third parties, but some users find it more convenient to do so via
              an intermediary of choice.

            <h3>Financials</h3>
            <p>
              Aktionariat AG has been founded in June 2020 and has not completed any accounting year yet.
              At the end of 2020, we had about 30'000 CHF liquidity left in our bank accounts and only minimal income.
              More details to be published soon.
              We do not expect to reach break-even in the coming years and therefore depend on further investments.
              These can come from
              three sources: the founders, employees using part of their salaries to buy more shares, and external
              investors that are
              adventerous enough to believe in our vision. Our aim is to route all of these transactions through our
              open market widget,
              giving every buyer the exact same opportunity to buy our shares and creating a high level of market
              transparency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Potential investors should note that unlike Bitcoin, shares of a company do not have a limited supply. The
              majority of the shareholders can always
              decide to print and offer more shares to finance the company's goals (if they finds a buyer). We plan to
              make extensive use of this possibility, leading
              to significant dilution over the coming years. However, unlike with Bitcoin, every shareholder always gets
              the right to buy his fair share of newly issued shares by law. This
              is one of the advantages of building on proven concepts and issuing another crypto currency: shares come
              with a bundle of legally enshrined and time-tested rights that
              protect the shareholders.

            <p>In our vision, a direct market is the central component of every investor relations page, enabling
              investors to buy and sell
              shares directly from the company. In this case, we offer <a target="_blank"
                href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f38e0f1a73c96cb3f42598613ea3474f09cb200">Aktionariat AG Shares
                (DAKS)</a>.
              These blockchain-based security tokens represent shares of Aktionariat AG that are bound to a <a
                target="_blank" href="assets/terms/Token Holder Agreement.pdf">Token Holder Agreement</a>.
              The token holder agreement preserves the strategic option of an exit by allowing an acquirer to squeeze
              out all minority shareholders in case a 75% majority
              agrees with the acquisition. This is usually called a "drag-along agreement", hence the prefix "Draggable"
              in the token name. The DAKS token contract allows
              the drag-along agreement to be automatically enforced, allowing it to be efficiently executed even if
              there are thousands of shareholders. At the same time, the agreement
              also protects the minority token holders by ensuring that they can sell their shares at the same price as
              the big shareholders in such an event ("tag-along").
