            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
              Aktionariat AG is a Swiss corporation based in Zurich with trade register number <a target="_blank"
                href="https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-453.438.437">CHE-453.438.437</a>.
              Its purpose is to enable Swiss companies to create a market for their shares.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will start to tokenize our shares using our own technology as soon as the Federal Council sets the
              Swiss "blockchain law" into force, which we hope to happen by summer 2021.
              In the meantime, feel free to play with our test tokenn named <a class=aktionariat-namelink>NAME</a>.
              There are <var class=aktionariat-totalshares></var> test tokens in circulation, out of which <var
                class=aktionariat-tokenizedshares></var> have been issued as blockchain-based ERC-20 named <a
                target="_blank" class=aktionariat-contractlink><var class=aktionariat-name></var></a>.
              <var class=aktionariat-treasuryshares></var> tokens are held by the company itself. The current market
              price per share is <var class=aktionariat-price></var>.
              You can trade them directly on this website using our <a href="#market">market widget</a> and a
              WalletConnect-compatible wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of which wallet you prefer to manage your private keys, we recommend to install the Aktionariat
              app to monitor your portfolio of crypto assets as it is the only wallet that is aware of the
              additional data available for our share tokens.

            <h2>Business Model</h2>
            <p>
              Markets work best when they are free and open. We wnat to make use of the latest legal end technical
              developments to create open and liquid markets for securities that hitherto were illiquid and hard to
              price.
              Even without trading, having a reliable price indication can unlock substantial value. For example, it
              creates a credible signal for employees regarding the true value of shares and allows investors to
              more reliably appreciate how well (or not so well) their portfolio is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that being enabler in this market should put us sooner or later into a position where we
              can capture some of the value we create. However, for the foreseeable future, we strictly prioritize
              growth
              and product development over revenue generation. We also decided to put a laser-sharp focus on the
              technical
              dimension, leaving legal consulting to partner firm <a target="_blank" href="https://lexr.ch">LEXR</a> and
              the provision of auxiliary financial services such as the custody of crypto assets to regulated financial
              intermediary. For the technically savvy, it will always be possible to enjoy the full spectrum of our
              services, but some users will always prefer doing so through an intermediary of choice.
