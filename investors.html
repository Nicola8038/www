          </div>
          <h2>General</h2>
          <p>
            Aktionariat AG is a Swiss corporation based in Zurich with trade register number <a
              id=gov-id>ZEFIX-LINK</a>.
            Its purpose is to enable Swiss companies to create a market for their shares.
            Its capital is divided into <var id=total-supply>TOTAL-SUPPLY</var> shares, out of which <var
              id=tokenized-shares>TOKENIZED-SHARES</var> have
            been issued as blockchain-based ERC-20 tokens with the ticker symbol <a id=ticker>TICKER</a>.
            <var id=treasury>TREASURY</var> shares are held by the company itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will start to tokenize our shares using our own technology as soon as the Federal Council sets the
            Swiss
            "blockchain law" into force, which we hope to happen by summer 2021.
            In the meantime, feel free to play with our test tokens with symbol <a target="_blank"
              href="https://etherscan.io">TAKT</a>.
            You can trade them directly on this website using our <a href="#automaton">Automaton</a> and a
            WalletConnect-compatible wallet.
            Regardless of which wallet you prefer to manage your private keys, we recommend to install the Aktionariat
            app to monitor your portfolio of crypto assets as it is the only wallet that is aware of the 
            additional data available for our share tokens.
          </p>

          <h2>Business Model</h2>
          <p>
            Markets work best when they are free and open. We wnat to make use of the latest legal end technical
            developments to create open and liquid markets for securities that hitherto were illiquid and hard to price.
            Even without trading, having a reliable price indication can unlock substantial value. For example, it
            creates a credible signal for employees regarding the true value of shares and allows investors to
            more reliably appreciate how well (or not so well) their portfolio is doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that being enabler in this market should put us sooner or later into a position where we
            can capture some of the value we create. However, for the foreseeable future, we strictly prioritize growth
            and product development over revenue generation. We also decided to put a laser-sharp focus on the technical
            dimension, leaving legal consulting to partner firm <a target="_blank" href="https://lexr.ch">LEXR</a> and
            the provision of auxiliary financial services such as the custody of crypto assets to regulated financial
            intermediary. For the technically savvy, it will always be possible to enjoy the full spectrum of our
            services, but some users will always prefer doing so through an intermediary of choice.

          <p>
            Registering your address is required to enjoy your rights as a shareholder in relation to
            the company (e.g. receiving dividends or voting at the general assembly).

            We use the services of <a target="_blank" href="https://aktionariat.com">Aktionariat</a> to
            automatically keep our shareholder registry up to date. By submitting your data you agree
            with Aktionariat processing your data and automatically registering yourself as
            a shareholder for all share tokens held on the registered address (now and in the future, and 
            potentially also for tokens of other issuers).
            In case you only want to be registered for specific shares, please get in touch with us.
            More details can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aktionariat/contracts/doc/shares.md">
            share transfer documentation</a> as well as
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://aktionariat.com/terms.html">privacy policy</a> of Aktionariat.
            By default, Aktionariat will also use your email address for important notifications such as an
            attacker trying to abuse the token recovery feature to get hold of your shares. Additional 
            notifications such as price updates must be explicitely enabled, e.g. in the Aktionariat app.
