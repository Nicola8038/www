            <h2>General</h2>
            <p>
              Aktionariat AG is a Swiss corporation based in Zurich with trade register number <a target="_blank"
                href="https://zh.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-453.438.437">CHE-453.438.437</a>.
              Its purpose is to enable Swiss companies to create a market for their shares.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will start to tokenize our shares using our own technology as soon as the Federal Council sets the
              Swiss "blockchain law" into force, which should happen some time in 2021.
              In the meantime, feel free to play with our test token.
              There are <var class=akt-totalshares></var> test tokens in circulation, out of which <var
                class=akt-tokenizedshares></var> have been issued as blockchain-based ERC-20 named <a
                target="_blank" class=akt-contractlink><var class=akt-name></var></a>.
              <var class=akt-treasuryshares></var> tokens are held by the company itself. The current market
              price per share is <var class=akt-price></var>.
              You can trade them directly on this website using our <a href="#market">market widget</a> and a
              WalletConnect-compatible wallet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of which wallet you prefer to manage your private keys, we recommend to install the Aktionariat
              app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/aktionariat/id1518326813?l=en">for iOS</a>, Android follows)
              to monitor your portfolio of crypto assets. The Aktionariat app can also display shares held in traditional
              form and assist existing shareholders in converting them into tokenized shares.

            <h2>Business Model</h2>
            <p>
              Markets work best when they are free and open. We leverage the latest legal and technical
              developments to create liquid markets for securities that hitherto were illiquid and hard to price.
              Even for those not interested in selling their shares, having a reliable price signal can unlock substantial value.
              For example, it creates a point of orientation for employees regarding the true value of their shares and
              enables investors to more reliably gauge how well (or not so well) their portfolio is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that being enabler in this market should put us sooner or later into a position where we
              can capture some of the value we create. However, for the foreseeable future, we strictly prioritize
              growth and product development over revenue generation. We also decided to put a laser-sharp focus on the
              technical dimension, leaving legal consulting to partner firm <a target="_blank" href="https://lexr.ch">LEXR</a>
              and the provision of auxiliary financial services such as the custody of crypto assets to regulated financial
              intermediaries. For the technically savvy, it will always be possible to enjoy the full spectrum of our
              services without relying on third parties, but some users find it more convenient to do so via
              an intermediary of choice.
